# PixelzJam2024
Zachary, Elly, and Madeline's work for the Pixel Art GameJam of 2024!

I know git is kinda confusing so I'm writing this mainly for Elly or if Zatch (or even Maddi, the one writing this) needs a reminder on how to do this! 

1: Download Tortoise Git 
  This is a little UI piece that makes using this repository easy overall! 
  
  https://tortoisegit.org 

  Use this link (above) and download it! Should be easy?

2: Clone the repo! 
  Cloning means you're copying everything and connecting your computer to this repo. 

  First, you're going to want to make a folder of some kind of folder that you want the repository to hang out, preferably easy access because you're gonna click on the folder a lot
  For example, I have one called " College - Maddi Games " The name can be anything this part doesn't matter just helps you stay organized. :)

  Go inside that folder and right-click, then go to more options. There should be a new beautiful button sitting there for you of Git Tortoise! If so huzzah! If not talk to me
  Click the button Git Clone... and add in this link: https://github.com/MaddiSmiles/PixelzJam2024.git 
  (You'd also be able to find this link by clicking  <>Code and make sure to use HTTPS)

  Woo There's now a new folder inside called PixelzJam2024 ! 
  Open Unity Hub and Click Add ->  Add project from disk -> and navigate to that folder from before and click on PixelsJam2024 and open. 
  As long as everything works out you should be all set!!!

  Down here I'll be adding in all needed routine things/tips I've learned over time!


  **To Push your changes**
    Pushing a change means that you are making your changes and replacing the repository's project with your version essentially. 
    This is one of the most important parts of making stuff aside from pulling which I will get to in a second.
    Once you've saved the project you are going to do the first half of the job-Commit! 

  Commit means you will be saying these are the changes you are making. Make sure to label everything and give a pretty solid description of everything you've touched. This helps us in the future if we start to see any issues. 
  Make sure to check everything you altered that pops up there and any assets you added to make sure we get them too! 
  Clicking ok and it should be successful! 

  Once you've committed, you are going to want to pull. This just makes sure that your current project works and is the current version so we don't end up with a mess later. This **should** go smoothly we pray.
  Once that's all said in done you push! This should also _hopefully_ go smoothly. 


  When pushing, it's really easy for issues to occur so we need to be careful. Here are a few tips I've learned 
  PUSH REGULARLY
  PULL OFTEN
  IF SOMEONE IS TOUCHING THE SCENE (specifically where assets are placed) DO NOT TOUCH THE SCENE this breaks a lot
  Be open about when you are working on stuff and make a note so two people aren't doing the same thing! 
  If there's a merge conflict (when two different versions of the same thing are pushed and the repository doesn't know which to pick I don't know how to deal with merge conflicts so we will go BACK to the last time it's working. This means for the love of god 
  PUSH OFTEN SO YOU LOSE MINUTES OF WORK RATHER THAN HOURS
  I'd recommend every 10-20 minutes max? before your next push probably! 
  If you have changes but want to revert to what the project is currently you can use git stash which will stash your changes away till later (git stash pop brings those old changes back if you want to)
