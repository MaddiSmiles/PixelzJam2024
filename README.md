# PixelzJam2024
Zachary, Elly, and Madeline's work for the Pixel Art GameJam of 2024!

I know git is kinda confusing so I'm writing this mainly for Elly or if Zatch (or even Maddi, the one writing this) needs a reminder on how to do this! 

1: Download Tortoise Git 
  This is a little UI piece that makes using this repository easy overall! 
  
  https://tortoisegit.org 

  Use this link (above) and download it! Should be easy?

2: Clone the repo! 
  Cloning means you're copying everything and connecting your computer to this repo.
